This is a follow up project for https://github.com/wikiti/pandoc-book-template

pandoc-book-template provides a greate template to convert markdown to a standalone html file. I found the template when I prepare to write an online book. But a single html is not suitable for online reading, especially there is not table ot conent on the left pane.

This project split pandoc generated html file to mulitple html files with Table of Content on the left, and chapters on the right pane.
